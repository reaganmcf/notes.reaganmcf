There is no book or Web site that tells how to translate the codes into dates.</li>\n<li>Cans may also display “open” or calendar dates. Usually these are “best if used by” dates for peak quality</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How long can you store canned foods?</h2>\n<p>General rule of thumb</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most canned foods (<strong>canned tuna, soups, and vegetables) can be stored for two to five years</strong></li>\n<li><strong>High-acid foods (canned juices, tomatoes, pickles) can be stored for a year up to 18 months</strong></li>\n<li>Dents and bulges in cans: a sign it’s time to toss these products</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How about frozen foods</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frozen foods won’t go bad because bacteria and other pathogens can’t grow in frozen temperatures</strong></li>\n<li>This even applies to <strong>milk, bread, cheese, and raw eggs (crack and lightly beat them first)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do we do now?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nonperishable items like grains and dried and canned goods can still be used well past their label dates</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Meat, dairy, and eggs: there are still <em>no federally regulated expiration dates</em> on those items, they obviously have shorter shelf lives</strong></li>\n<li>The best way to know whether a perishable food has spoiled is simply to “trust your taste buds and sense of smell”</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 18, 2021","slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture1","title":"Foods - Lecture 1"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"547a64a6-38ec-54d9-9bd5-157a543c6cb7","frontmatter__slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture1","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"food-farm-to-table"}}},
