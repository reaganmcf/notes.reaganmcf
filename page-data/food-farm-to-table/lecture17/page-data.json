it’s also the pesticides, fertilizers, fuel, and water needed to produce the feed for all those cows and pigs</li>\n<li>The message instead is simply to eat and waste less of what we produce and to look for greener options - meat from grass-fed, pasture-raised animals, for example</li>\n<li>Asking everyone to go vegetarian or vegan is not a realistic or attainable goal, chef and television personality Mario Batali told EWG. “But we can focus on a more plant-based diet and support the farmers who raise their animals humanely and sustainably”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CO2 Emissions Ranked</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Lamb</li>\n<li>Beef</li>\n<li>Cheese</li>\n<li>Pork</li>\n<li>Farmed Salmon</li>\n<li>Turkey</li>\n<li>Chicken</li>\n<li>Canned Tuna</li>\n<li>Eggs</li>\n<li>Potatoes</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The carbon footprint of the first Thanksgiving meal was approximatelyz zero.</li>\n<li>A bird emits a significantly smaller amount of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide in its waste than a cow or a sheep does.</li>\n<li>The green veggies are likely to be the most Earth-friendly part of your Thanksgiving meal</li>\n<li>Thanksgiving meals might be responsible for emitting more than 10 pounds of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Food miles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Food miles purportedly measure the carbon footprint of food production and distribution</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A single indicator based on miles traveled is not a valid indicator of sustainability</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growing food locally may require a considerable amount of carbon producing energy compared to growing in ideal, and sometimes distant, environments where production is less energy intensive</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Miles traveled is merely one small indicator of emission</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smaller, family run farms do best in the local food economy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Naysayers of local food systems: food transported long distances can have less of an environmental impact than locally growing foods</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In 2011, a study examined the effects of localizing all fruit and vegetable consumption in Santa Barbara county, CA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was less than 1%</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Local Food Systems</h3>\n<p>If local food system produced food in a way that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sequesters soil carbon</li>\n<li>Naturally maintains soil fertility</li>\n<li>Does not depend on toxic chemicals</li>\n<li>Optimized transportation &#x26; distribution</li>\n<li>Consumers stored, prepared food in a way that conserved energy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then there would be huge savings</p>\n<h3>Water footprint</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The largest water footprint of a beverage company, for example, is not bottled water</li>\n<li>Instead, it can be traced to the main agricultural ingredients used in flavored drinks, such as sugar, oranges or barely</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Diesel</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Current fuel of choice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Natural gas substitution?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not a suitable alternative</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Premium product</li>\n<li>Used for production of chemicals, plastics, fertilizers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The more massive and slower a transportation vehicle is: the less energy it uses</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lighter, high speed vehicles - deliver faster; with higher energy consumption</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Chocolate vs. Lettuce</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The real impact of distance when transporting foods, depends on caloric content of foods &#x26; transportation methods</li>\n<li>Lettuce: highly perishable; high impact on energy spent in relation to its energy content</li>\n<li>An iceberg lettuce flown from California to UK by air needs 127 calories of fuel for every calorie provided by the lettuce</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Waste Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>High on food processor’s agenda today</li>\n<li>Manufacturers and retailers are taking steps to reduce food waste, however\n<ul>\n<li>“hidden waste” is not accounted for in traditional waste disposal streams</li>\n<li>Consumer waste is relatively greater than that associated with manufacturers and retailers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Issues with Green Revolution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Global warming - as it relies heavily on fossil fuels</li>\n<li>As an industry - farming world’s single largest consumer of petroleum products - oil, coal, natural gas - finite</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 28, 2021","slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture17","title":"Foods - Lecture 17"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b8a414a4-2bf3-5adb-bc30-a18d73653984","frontmatter__slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture17","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"food-farm-to-table"}}},
