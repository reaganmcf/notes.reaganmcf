People who got the North Dakota bottle rated the wine and the meal lower.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The notion that our taste perceptions are biased by our imagination, and if you expect a food to taste good it will. And if you expect a food to taste unpleasant it will.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Age appears to be a factor that significantly determines what and why one eats and drinks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Older adults (45-69 years) tend to plan their eating and drinking as part of a meal more than younger respondents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Older adults also appear to depend on routine to trigger their eating and drinking more than younger adults.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They suggested <strong>that time of day was a more important trigger for them than hunger or thirst</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nutrition experts often discuss moderation of food and beverage consumption. However, <strong>what motivates the average person to stop eating is rarely eating a “healthy serving size.”</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The 3 main reasons they stopped eating were “the food was gone”, “I felt satisfied”, followed by “I had eaten enough”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Specialists vs. Generalists</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Specialists</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consume limited number of foods</li>\n<li>Examples: Koalas - eucalyptus leaves; Carnivores - meat</li>\n<li>Advantage - requires less natural resources compared to generalists</li>\n<li>Disadvantage - much more limited in food source</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Generalists</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Omnivores - consume variety of foods</li>\n<li>Examples: humans, rats, bears, pigs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sensory Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Taste is the #1 factor to determine our food choices</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No matter how nutritious, safe and high quality a product is, if it does not taste good, we will not be likely to choose it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Actually, it is a combination of all the sensory characteristics- flavor, appearance, and texture</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Eyes, ears, tongue, mouth: all of these organs contribute to “Tastes” of foods</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Taste + Smell + Flavor</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Taste &#x26; smell: work together to establish flavor of a food or beverage; smell plays the primary role</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smell is arguably more important than taste</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When we chew, aromas are released to activate our sense of smell by the way of a special channel that connects the roof of the throat to the nose</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Appearance Factors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2 Categories</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1. Color</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If colors do not match the perception of the consumer, they may not purchase the product</li>\n<li>Have you seen green ketchup?</li>\n<li>Alternate color choices are short-lived</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Geometric attributes: Size and Shape</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumer expectations</li>\n<li>Computerized electronic equipment determine the size and shape of the food we consume at the factories</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Flavor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Combination of <strong>taste and smell</strong></li>\n<li>Most of what we perceive as taste, is actually smell</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Texture</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeds to our sense of food</li>\n<li>Does not seem important; but that is the one that leads to our <strong>rejection of foods</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Taste preferences</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Genetic makeup</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Has a lot to do with which tastes we find appealing &#x26; which ones we cannot tolerate</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Life’s experiences</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Also shape taste preferences</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Complicated</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Each taste quality - sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami- is like a separate sense</li>\n<li>They all start in the same <strong>taste bud - the organ of taste in our tongue</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Complicated taste</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More complicated than hearing, vision, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human’s have at least 25 different receptors to sense bitter tastes… Why?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bitter</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tasting things that are often toxic, so being sensitive to bitter tastes is critical for survival</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spoilt food tastes dour</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>So we turn away from things that are spoiled or dangerous</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bitter and sour</strong> are termed <strong>“aversive” tastes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humans tend not to like these tastes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Salty, sweet and umami: “appetitive”</strong> tastes</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweet = calories; a natural signal</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Salty = minerals needed for proper body’s functioning</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Umami/savory = taste of protein</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Taste system</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>brain detects the taste of food</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smell or olfaction is a <strong>chemical</strong> sense</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Occurs in 2 ways</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly through the nose</li>\n<li>Retro nasally - when you chew food, chemicals in the food vaporize and stimulate the nose from the back</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Human’s are capable of identifying 1000s of odors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Smell is a more “plastic sense”: <strong>driven by experiences, learning</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Aroma of foods is believed to account for as much as 80-85% of the flavor of food</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to develop products successfully for the population</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>** Most product developers target 50% or so of the population described as tasters\n<ul>\n<li>Those with middle-of-the-road taste sensibilities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Low end: not picky</li>\n<li>Super tasters: picky</li>\n<li>Need to design foods for the center of the bell curve</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 25, 2021","slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture3","title":"Foods - Lecture 3"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"36ba2a1a-a869-5f6d-a261-c6436f6b937a","frontmatter__slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture3","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"food-farm-to-table"}}},
