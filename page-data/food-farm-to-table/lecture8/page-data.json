This can be done by <strong>slowing down respiration</strong> as much as possible (without stopping it)</li>\n<li>One way to slow down respiration is by <strong>controlling the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/cd7f8226eaf02cb9612a7511ab104de6.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/80c403f6a478591d531fdaa1ecf4d576.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>Designing MAP</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally, a pack of vegetables should be designed in such a way that the optimal gas concentration is stable and exactly that which is best for the product</li>\n<li>Three main gasses used in MAP are C02, O2, and N2. <strong>The choice of gas is very dependent upon the food product being packed</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is ripening?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fruits aren’t very appetizing when they’re unripe, they’re not as sweet and soft</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only when fruits have gone through their ripening process they’ll develop their appealing flavor and texture characteristics. Ripening is the final stage in growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If <strong>ethylene is not controlled post-harvest losses occur</strong> significantly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One of the common method farmers do to prevent post-harvest losses is harvest the produce unripe, and then artificially ripen it by spraying ethylene.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This allows farmers to <strong>transport their produce</strong> at the optimum freshness and quality</li>\n<li>This is especially true for <strong>produce meant for long-term storage</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The FDA has approved the use of ethylene as a commercial ripening agent.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In general, <strong>low temperatures slow down</strong> metabolism, and this includes <strong>ethylene production in plant tissues</strong>. This is the reason why it is <strong>ideal to store the produce at chilling temperature</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bananas</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bananas are harvest when they’re still green and unripe.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pears are special because they are best harvested unripe</strong>, ripening on the tree will even decrease their quality due to stoniness.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control of ethylene gas after plucking extends the life cycle of the fruit / vegetable.</strong> Ethylene control enables warehouse owners not only to <strong>preserve freshness and reduce spoilage</strong> but also allows them to <strong>meet increasing demands for non-seasonal fruits and vegetables</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Juices - why heat juices?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pasteurization, unlike sterilization, doesn’t kill off all the micro-organisms in orange juice. Especially, spores will survive. These spores are very resistant to heat treatment. However, these generally do not grow at the pH of orange juice. Therefore, <strong>pasteurization is good enough for stabilization of orange juice for a couple months</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another common trick is that the orange juice is de-aerated, which will <strong>take out the oxygen of the juice</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumers tend to think that clear, unclouded OJ has been watered down or lacks freshness</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Homogenization</strong>: This is a special process for making cloudy juice, usually for products packaged into bottles. During this process, <strong>the particles contained in juice are further crushed into smaller size, where pectin ooze out and disperse into the orange juice homogeneously. BY these means, we get cloudy juice</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep juice clear, you <strong>remove starches and pectin</strong></p>\n<h3>What is fruit juice and fruit juice concentrate?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Juice Concentrate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whole fruits are thoroughly washed, scrubbed, and crushed or blended to produce a pulp.</li>\n<li>Most of the water content is then extracted and evaporated</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‘From concentrate’ means that all the excess <strong>water</strong> from the <strong>oranges</strong> is removed, yielding a product seven times more concentrated than the initial juice</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compressing and then freezing the orange juice allows more efficient packaging and transportation</strong></li>\n<li>Water is then added in again before it is sold</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Juice ‘From Concentrate’ means that the juice was dehydrated, shipped to a factory, rehydrated, and packages.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Benzoates + sorbates used in combination with low temperatures to extend the shelf life of minimally processed juice drinks</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The term **“no preservation added” has the false connotation of improved quality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Some pasteurized juices have a biting aftertaste due to excessive benzoate. The overuse is not harmful</strong>, but ironically completely unnecessary in adequately pasteurized juice. <strong>The philosophy, “if a little is good, more is better” has no place in food processing. Under no circumstances should any preservative be a substitute for sanitary practices”</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 18, 2021","slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture8","title":"Processing of Fruits & Vegetables"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a45595a3-9c44-5705-b1ec-5eba4d67b5c9","frontmatter__slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture8","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"food-farm-to-table"}}},
