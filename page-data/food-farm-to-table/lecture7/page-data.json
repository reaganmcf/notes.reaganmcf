Grains are revealed; can be toasted, soaked, or cooked to soften and release starch and carbohydrates.</strong></p>\n<h2>Commodity crops</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Corn and soybeans: increasing demand as both animal and human foods</strong>; profitable in price</li>\n<li>Rice: relatively stable production last 20 years; not a dietary staple in the US</li>\n<li>Wheat: spike in prices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But what are commodity crops?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wheat, Corn, Rice, Oats, Cotton, soybeans</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be easily traded</li>\n<li>Stored for a long time</li>\n<li>Grown in large quantities</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Example, when you think of cotton you don’t ask where it’s grown or what year it was harvested - it’s just “cotton”. That’s what a <strong>commodity crop</strong> is</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Storage and Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Commodity crops; long shelf life when kept cool and dry</li>\n<li>At 70F: dried grains, beans last over 10 years</li>\n<li><strong>Minimum energy needed to store products</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Since perishability is not an issue, slow, cheap, transportation methods are used</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wheat kernel or seed:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Endosperm</strong>: 83% of the grain; typically used in refined bread flower</li>\n<li><strong>Bran</strong>: Rich in fiber, vitamins &#x26; minerals</li>\n<li><strong>Germ</strong>: vitamins, minerals, fat, protein</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Steps in Wheat Milling</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Olden days millstones replaced today with rollers\n<ul>\n<li>Separate the bran, germ, and endosperm layers\n<ul>\n<li>Endosperm layer - starch or flour</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Final milling by-product is wheat shorts</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consist of bran, germ, flour and tailings</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Used to be for cattle feed only</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Now, the bran, germ marketed as “Viable health food”</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fatty acids in germ contribute to off-flavors and rancidity, it is removed; storage time of white flour improved when compared to wheat flour</strong></p>\n<h3>Bleaching and maturing of flour</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>*<em>Final stage in the production of white flour</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>FDA approved use of agents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tetroxide, chlorine dioxied, benzyl peroxide, acetone peroxides, azodicarbonamide</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>WHY?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh milled, unbleached flour - yellowish due to natral pigments in wheat</li>\n<li>Fresh milled flour - yields small, coarse-textured loaf</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solution: store the flour for several <strong>months to lighten color, improve baking qualities</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>FDA approved agents - similar effects in short period of time</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commerically made white bread, made from bleached flour, was considered a modern food and was more expensive than whole wheat bread</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>White bread was favored; a status symbol</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1920s: <strong>wonder bread - with 12 vitamins, minerals - heavily advertised as healthy food for children</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Today, whole wheat bread is more expensive than white bread; changing dynamics of food technology, nutrition and science on food choices</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bread production</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.gyazo.com/1c77030d3f2ee232a5bd0a8db62025a4.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ingredient mixing and dough development</li>\n<li>Automatic dough slicing and depositing into bread pans/trays</li>\n<li>Proofing / second rise</li>\n<li>Baking the loaves in hot-air convection oven</li>\n<li>Cooling the bread, separating the loaves from the bread pans</li>\n<li>Slicing and packaging</li>\n<li>Delivery to retail outlets</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Products from corn</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sweeteners: glucose, dextrose, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup</strong></li>\n<li>Oils, feed, meal, fiber foods</li>\n<li>Modified corn starch: thickeners in foods</li>\n<li>Ethanol: fuel and beverage alcohol</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dry milling corn</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>dry milling process</strong> requires the miller to remove the corn hull and germ without reducing the endosperm</li>\n<li>This process produces flaking grits, meals, flours, oil</li>\n<li><strong>Breakfast cereal</strong> is produced from large flaking grits</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rice</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Has traveled from China to India/Pakistan to Africa to Middle East, to Europe, finally arriving in South Carolina</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Labor-intensive crop</strong>;

used by processors, cereal manufacturers and pet food manufacturers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Soybeans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The two major products from soybean processing are high-protein meal and oil.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Food uses of oil include shortening, margarine, and cooking and salad oils; nonfood uses include paint, varnish, resins, and plastics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soybean meal, which is the largest product produced from this process, is used by the feed industry as a protein supplement.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bean family; primarily used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Livestock feed</li>\n<li>Vegetable oil (80% of oil consumed in US)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once beans reach the processors</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processed directly into products made from whole soybeans - soymilk, flour, tofu</li>\n<li>Further refining: clean, dry, crack the hull form soybean\n<ul>\n<li>Hulls go for animal feed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remaining portion converted into animal food flakes and soy flour\n<ul>\n<li>Flakes: used to extract soybean oil and lecithin</li>\n<li><strong>Lecithin: widely used emulsifier in salad dressings, mayonnaise, ice cream…</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Oats</h2>\n<h3>Steel Cut Oats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Whole grains is cut into several pieces</li>\n<li>Longest to cook</li>\n<li>Toothsome, chewy texture</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rolled oats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Whole grains first steamed then pressed to flatten them</li>\n<li>Cook faster than steel-cut oats</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instant Oats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Most processed</li>\n<li>Whole grains pre-cooked, dried, and then rolled and pressed thinner</li>\n<li>Cook more quickly</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 08, 2021","slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture7","title":"Foods - Lecture 7"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ad774dc2-a213-592d-a621-435f2acbd9f2","frontmatter__slug":"/food-farm-to-table/lecture7","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"food-farm-to-table"}}},
