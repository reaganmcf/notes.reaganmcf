And then it hit me, why don‚Äôt I just <strong>build</strong> exactly what I need?</p>\n<h2>And so that‚Äôs what this site is - my solution for my problem</h2>\n<p>I needed a solution that supported the following</p>\n<ol>\n<li>File backups / Cloud support</li>\n<li>Easily share my notes with others (for free)</li>\n<li>Use an editor that supported VIM Keybindings</li>\n<li>Lots of customization options</li>\n</ol>\n<p>None of the options I listed above gave me <strong>all 4</strong> of these (many give 3/4).</p>\n<p>So, I built this site, and use VIM to write my notes as Markdown files. I push my notes to GitHub (file backups), and then this Gatsby site automatically builds and publishes my notes - the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>The best part, I can customize anything and add any new features I want, as I discover I need them.</p>\n<h2>‚ÄúHow do I get something like this?‚Äù</h2>\n<p>You can find the open source repository for the site <a href=\"https://github.com/reaganmcf/notes.reaganmcf\">here</a> and clone it yourself. The code is simple enough I don‚Äôt believe it warrants an entire blog post series. If you run into any problems, feel free to open an issue on the repository and I‚Äôll be more than willing to help you debug üôÇ</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 17, 2021","slug":"/","title":"Home"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"34e6d85a-7652-5923-b95d-f466b4908482","frontmatter__slug":"/","__params":{}}},
