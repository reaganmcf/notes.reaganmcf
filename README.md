# Hey There! âœ‹

Welcome to `notes.reaganmcf`, my website for publishing all of my notes I take at university.

I've tried about every single note taking app under the sun, including:

- Notion
- Obsidian
- IPad w/ Apple Pencil
- Bear
- Plain old handwriting

After trying all of them, I've figured out exactly what I **need** and **don't need** from a note taking application. And then it hit me, why don't I just **build** exactly what I need?

## And so that's what this site is - my solution for my problem

I needed a solution that supported the following

1. File backups / Cloud support
2. Easily share my notes with others (for free)
3. Use an editor that supported VIM Keybindings
4. Lots of customization options

None of the options I listed above gave me **all 4** of these (many give 3/4).

So, I built this site, and use VIM to write my notes as Markdown files. I push my notes to GitHub (file backups), and then this Gatsby site automatically builds and publishes my notes - the perfect solution.

The best part, I can customize anything and add any new features I want, as I discover I need them.

## "How do I get something like this?"

You can clone this repo yourself. The code is simple enough I don't believe it warrants an entire blog post series. If you run into any problems, feel free to open an issue on the repository and I'll be more than willing to help you debug ðŸ™‚
