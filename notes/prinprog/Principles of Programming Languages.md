## Introduction
### Topics
- Several paradigms for programming
	- Procedural (Java, C)
	- Functional ([[Haskell]])
	- Logic ([[Prolog]])
- Some topics that apply to all languages
	- Variables, subroutines, parameter passing
	- Formalisms for specifying syntax (grammars, [[Regular Expressions]])
	- Types and type checking
- We will see how much of this we get through
### Priorities
- Learn new ways of thinking about problems and programs
- Practice learning new languages, so you can learn more over time
- Try out a few languages you may not have used before
### Grading
- This course will have homework assignments, in-class tests, and a final exam
	- Assignments: 40%
	- Tests: 35%
	- Final exam: 25%
- Tests and exam will be administered on-line via Canvas
	- You will have a fixed amount of time for each test, within a 24-hour window
### Assignments
- Assignments will be handed in electronically via Canvas
- Late submission will lose points (up to 50%)
	- Plan ahead, and do not try to submit at the last minute
	- The closer you get to the deadline, the more catastrophic an accident can be
- Back up your work - you can even submit a draft early, and then resubmit again before the deadline
- Please do not make your answers publicly viewable online
### Tools
- Programming assignments will be written in [[Haskell]] or [[Prolog]]
- The recommended compilers are GHC and SWI-[[Prolog]]
- These are installed on the Meltdown, Command Center, and Cave clusters of the ilab
- You may also install these compilers on your own devices

## Major Topics
- [[Languages and Paradigms]]
- [[Building Blocks]]
