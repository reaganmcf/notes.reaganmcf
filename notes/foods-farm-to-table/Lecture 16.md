# Lecture 16 - Non-Thermal Processing of Food

80-90% of foods used in home cooking are at least semi-processed

## Why Non-Thermal?

Heat can degrade nutritional, sensory (flavor, color, texture, shape), and in case of seeds, germination properties

## HPP

HPP, or High Pressure Processing, subjects liquids or solid foods, with or without packaging, to pressures between 40 and 1000 MPa (1-20 min)

The pressure is equivalent to around 3 African elephants standing on a 18mm diameter disk

### Foods and packages that can or cannot be treated with High Pressure

- Can
  - Liquid foods, Soft solids, high moisture foods are better
  - Plastic bottles, pouches, flexible plastic cups, trays, are OK
- Cannot
  - Foods with large air pockets are not suitable, e.g., bread, whole strawberry, whole eggs
  - Rigid containers such as glass jars / bottles, cans are not suitable
