# Lecture 14 - From Farms to Supermarkets

Where does the food go from the farm?

- After being grown, processed, and packaged, food enters an extensive distribution network
- Perishable foods, too, transported great distances in refrigerated trucks; US is a large country
- In US, supermarkets are the predominant type of food retailer
- The seller must consider factors such as
  - Positioning
  - Branding
  - Pricing: shelves between knees and shoulder height have the highest mark up items; the paths to milk and bread are strewn with high-priced land mines

## Fair Trade USA

- Safe working conditions, consistent means for livelihoods and protection for the environment
- Some Fair Trade fruits you will easily spot are:
  - Fruits
  - Chocolate
  - Tea, Coffee
  - Sugar, Honey
  - Bean Sprouts
  - Peanuts

### Fair Trade Standards

Set by the Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International

- Purpose: to promote and safeguard the interests of Fair Trade certified producer organizations
- GM products are banned by the FLO; a composite product, like a chocolate bar, may contain GM ingredients and carry the Fairtrade mark.
  - At least 50% of the total ingredients must be sourced from Fairtrade certified producers
- Specific ingredients in a composite product are not vetted by Fairtrade standards of certification to be GM free
- Only those fairtrade products that carry the organic certification would be GM free

## Supermarkets
- Fresh produce is a main driver for consumers on where to shop
- The floral department is nearly always located by the entryway as it boosts the store's image in the shopper's mind through the bright colors and fragrant smells

### Produce

- Fresh product: #1 determinant of quality

#### Spinach
- High in vitamins A & C; high in iron & folate; good source of magnesium

#### Kale
- Excellent source of vitamins A and C; good source of calcium and potassium
