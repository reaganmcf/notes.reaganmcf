# Processing of Fruits & Vegetables

- Companies in this industry use freezing, canning, dehydrating, and pickling to preserve fruits and vegetables.
- Major US based companies: Kraft Heinz, JR Simplot, and Pinnacle Foods & divisions of large food companies such as ConAgra and General Mills
- Bonduelle (France); AGRANA (Austria); Del Monte Pacific (Singapore), McCain Foods (Canada); Pinguin (Belgium); La Doria (Italy)

- **The major processed crops in the US are tomatoes (solid tomato and tomato paste products)**
- **Potatoes (French fries, potato chips); and oranges (orange juice)**
- **Corn; cucumbers (pickles); beans; grapefruit; apples (apple juice, applesauce); grapes (raisins); pineapples; peaches**
- The two major types of operations are canning and freezing. **Canned goods and frozen foods each account for about 45% of industry revenue;** dried foods account for about 10%

### Why are fruits and Vegetables crisp?

- Turgor pressure:
  - Vacuoles in cells filled with water; pressure is exerted on the cytoplasm and partially elastic cell wall
  - **RAW F & V prior to harvesting is crisp; because of large %age of water from the plant**
  - **After "pickled": water is lost to air, with evaporation or low humidity storage**: loss of turgor pressure
  - F & V wilt, limp, dehydrated
  - If the paranechyma cell is still intact, water may reenter: Soaking rehydrates

### Harvested vegetables are alive

- The **trick to storing vegetables for a long period of time** is thus to **keep respiration** going for as long as possible. This can be done by **slowing down respiration** as much as possible (without stopping it)
- One way to slow down respiration is by **controlling the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide**

### Designing MAP

- Ideally, a pack of vegetables should be designed in such a way that the optimal gas concentration is stable and exactly that which is best for the product
- Three main gasses used in MAP are C02, O2, and N2. **The choice of gas is very dependent upon the food product being packed**

### What is ripening?

- Fruits aren't very appetizing when they're unripe, they're not as sweet and soft
- Only when fruits have gone through their ripening process they'll develop their appealing flavor and texture characteristics. Ripening is the final stage in growth.
- If **ethylene is not controlled post-harvest losses occur** significantly
- One of the common method farmers do to prevent post-harvest losses is harvest the produce unripe, and then artificially ripen it by spraying ethylene.
  - This allows farmers to **transport their produce** at the optimum freshness and quality
  - This is especially true for **produce meant for long-term storage**
- **The FDA has approved the use of ethylene as a commercial ripening agent.**

- In general, **low temperatures slow down** metabolism, and this includes **ethylene production in plant tissues**. This is the reason why it is **ideal to store the produce at chilling temperature**

#### Bananas

- **Bananas are harvest when they're still green and unripe.**
- **Pears are special because they are best harvested unripe**, ripening on the tree will even decrease their quality due to stoniness.

- **Control of ethylene gas after plucking extends the life cycle of the fruit / vegetable.** Ethylene control enables warehouse owners not only to **preserve freshness and reduce spoilage** but also allows them to **meet increasing demands for non-seasonal fruits and vegetables**

### Juices - why heat juices?

- Pasteurization, unlike sterilization, doesn't kill off all the micro-organisms in orange juice. Especially, spores will survive. These spores are very resistant to heat treatment. However, these generally do not grow at the pH of orange juice. Therefore, **pasteurization is good enough for stabilization of orange juice for a couple months**
- Another common trick is that the orange juice is de-aerated, which will **take out the oxygen of the juice**.

- **Consumers tend to think that clear, unclouded OJ has been watered down or lacks freshness**

- **Homogenization**: This is a special process for making cloudy juice, usually for products packaged into bottles. During this process, **the particles contained in juice are further crushed into smaller size, where pectin ooze out and disperse into the orange juice homogeneously. BY these means, we get cloudy juice**

To keep juice clear, you **remove starches and pectin**

### What is fruit juice and fruit juice concentrate?

- Juice Concentrate
  - Whole fruits are thoroughly washed, scrubbed, and crushed or blended to produce a pulp.
  - Most of the water content is then extracted and evaporated
- 'From concentrate' means that all the excess **water** from the **oranges** is removed, yielding a product seven times more concentrated than the initial juice
  - **Compressing and then freezing the orange juice allows more efficient packaging and transportation**
  - Water is then added in again before it is sold
- **Juice 'From Concentrate' means that the juice was dehydrated, shipped to a factory, rehydrated, and packages.**

- **Benzoates + sorbates used in combination with low temperatures to extend the shelf life of minimally processed juice drinks**
- The term \*\*"no preservation added" has the false connotation of improved quality
- **Some pasteurized juices have a biting aftertaste due to excessive benzoate. The overuse is not harmful**, but ironically completely unnecessary in adequately pasteurized juice. **The philosophy, "if a little is good, more is better" has no place in food processing. Under no circumstances should any preservative be a substitute for sanitary practices"**
