# Introduction

- Food science is an **Applied Science**

## Food Waste is Big!

- **Every day the average American throws out nearly a pound of food**, according to a study from the Department of Agriculture
- There's more foods in landfills than anything else, and that produces the greenhouse gas methane.

## "Expiration Date" you see on foods

- **Sell by**
- **Use by**
- "Best If Used By/Before\*\*

### Open Dating vs Closed Dating

- **Open Dating** is found primarily on perishable foods such as meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products
- **Closed** or **coded** dating might appear on shelf-stable products such as cans and boxes of food

#### Sell By Date

- The **date set by manufacturers to tell retailers when to remove a product from the shelves**
- To ensure that consumers have products at their best quality, which can be several days to several weeks, depending on the item
- For instance, milk, assuming proper refrigeration, should last five to seven days past its sell-by-date before turning sour.

#### Use By Date

- The last date recommended for the use of the **product while at peak quality**
- Date determined by the manufacturer
- **Not a safety date except when used on infant formula**

#### Best if Used By (or Before) date

- Recommended for **best flavor or quality**
- **Not purchase date**
- For instance, a jar of salsa may not taste as fresh or crackers may be soft instead of crisp after this date. **It's not about safety**

#### Closed or Coded dates

- Packing numbers or codes that are used by the manufacturer to locate and track in the event of recall
- These codes, which appear as a series and/or numbers, might refer to the date or time of manufacture.
- They aren't meant for the consumer to interpret as "use-by" dates. There is no book or Web site that tells how to translate the codes into dates.
- Cans may also display "open" or calendar dates. Usually these are "best if used by" dates for peak quality

## How long can you store canned foods?

General rule of thumb

- Most canned foods (**canned tuna, soups, and vegetables) can be stored for two to five years**
- **High-acid foods (canned juices, tomatoes, pickles) can be stored for a year up to 18 months**
- Dents and bulges in cans: a sign it's time to toss these products

## How about frozen foods

- **Frozen foods won't go bad because bacteria and other pathogens can't grow in frozen temperatures**
- This even applies to **milk, bread, cheese, and raw eggs (crack and lightly beat them first)**

## What do we do now?

- **Nonperishable items like grains and dried and canned goods can still be used well past their label dates**
- **Meat, dairy, and eggs: there are still _no federally regulated expiration dates_ on those items, they obviously have shorter shelf lives**
- The best way to know whether a perishable food has spoiled is simply to "trust your taste buds and sense of smell"
