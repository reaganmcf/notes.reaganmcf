# Food Processing

- How big is the food industry?
  - Second largest manufacturing industry sector in the US with sales over 5.32 trillion as of 2014

## Food Engineering vs Food Processing

**Food Engineering**

- Application of Mathematical and Physical science principles to enable to development of food processing operations for the **manufacture of foods in large quantities** and with narrow tolerances to the consumer high quality, safe and healthy foods
- **Main emphasis is on**
  - Large quantities
  - Equipment
    Properties of food materials, i.e., thermal, physical, rheological
  - Packaging design
  - Mathematical applications

**Food Processing**

- Applying Food Engineering, Food Chemistry, Food Biology principles to foods and food ingredients to impart specific **quality and safety**
- **Main emphasis is on**
  - **Ensure food safety**
  - Increase digestibility and **shelf life**
  - Add value (texture, flavor, color)

### Food processing

- New or old technology?
  - We have used science and technology for thousands of years to help to provide adequate food
  - The progression from hunter-gatherer to agriculture led to the need to store and preserve foods
  - **Without some form of processing, foods deteriorate rapidly due to the action of micro-organisms and enzymes**
- What **early methods of processing and preservation can you think of?**

  - Using chemicals
    - Pickling
    - Salting meat
    - Sugar to make jam
    - Storing in Alcohol
  - Temperature control
    - Sun drying fruit
    - Using ice blocks

- **The major processed crops in the US are tomatoes, potatoes, and oranges**
- Also, corn, cucumbers, jams / jellies, etc.
- Canned goods and frozen foods each account for about 45% of industry revenue; dried foods account for about 10%

### Climacteric Fruits vs. Non-Climacteric Fruits

| Climacteric Fruits                                                          | Non-Climacteric Fruits                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apples, Apricots, Avocado, Banana, Peach, Pear, Plum, Tomato, Papaya, Mango | Cherry, Citrus Fruits, Grapes, Melon, Pineapple, Strawberry |
| **Ripen after harvesting**                                                  | **Ripen prior to harvest **                                 |

#### Ethylene

- **Ethylene** is important in fresh produce marketing
- Used commercially for the artificial ripening of the climacteric fruits
- This **has made it possible for tropical fruits such as mangoes and bananas to be harvested green and shipped to distant market,s where they are ripened under controlled conditions.**

### Minimally processed foods

- In recent years, demand has increased for minimally processed foods which retain their freshness. New techniques have replaced methods that rely on heating and drying.
- **Modified atmosphere packaging is a way of extending the shelf life of fresh food products.**
- The technology substitutes the air inside a package with a protective gas mix.
- The gas in the package helps ensure that the product will stay fresh for as long as possible

### Active / Smart Packaging

- Extending functionality of food packaging beyond containment
- **Package used actively to cook product inside the package**
  - Example: Steam fresh vegetables that reheat in the bag in the microwave.

#### Microwave heating

- Conversion of electrical energy to microwave energy to heat foods (magnetron)
- Interacts with charged molecules and heats by friction

  - Water
  - Salt
  - Sugars

- Remaining heat takes place by conduction

##### Quality control in Microwavable bags

- **FDA regulates the food packaging material** and also polymers that can be used as indirect contact with products that are cooked inside the package
- They also regulate new materials used for microwave cooking or other new cooking technologies inside package
- **USDA regulates the product temperature**: Food safety partners launch campaign to reduce food poisoning due to undercooked pre-prepared foods, a consumer awareness program for microwavable frozen foods by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) in partnership with the Internal Food Information Council

### Thermal Processing

**Use of high temperatures** to destroy enzymes and microorganisms that could reduce quality and/or safety of food

#### 1. Blanching

A mild heat treatment that primarily destroys enzymes and reduces microbial load (**does not necessarily kill pathogens**), further preservation methods needed to extend shelf life

- Example: **Vegetables-frozen, canned**

#### 2. Pasteurization

A **mild heat treatment** used primarily **to destroy pathogenic organisms** but it also destroys enzymes and reduces microbial load. Requires an addition preservation method to extend shelf life

- Example: Refrigeration, drying

- Used for **milk, liquid eggs, fruit juices, and beer**
- Destroy pathogens
- Reduce microbial load
- Inactivate enzymes
- Extend shelf life

#### 3. Commercial Sterilization

A **severe heat treatment** that destroys pathogenic microorganisms that could spoil food. Extends shelf life, room temperature stable

- **Canned foods**

#### Canning

- Canning is hermetic sealing
  - Hermetic = airtight; no oxygen
- **Food is heated after packaging in canning**
- Severe heat used to inhibit spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms
- Those microorganisms capable of growth, spoilage under normal handling and storage conditions
- The product may contain viable spores, but they will not grow under normal conditions
- Temperature range for canning: **241-250F**

- **Main purpose of canning**

  - **Commercial sterility of food products**
  - **Extended shelf life**

- _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, may be present in high-acid foods; but, they do not germinate and grow; so, no hazard

  - **Home canned tomatoes, OK**
  - **Home canned beans, NO**

- **Canned foods: definitely not a daily dietary staple recommendation, but need not be totally avoided**
