# Lecture 12 - Industrial Animal Food Production

- Animals raised for food in US outnumber humans by 7:1

- **IFAP: Industrial Food Animal Protection**
  - **Predominant approach to meat (pork, beef, poultry), dairy and egg production in US**
  - **Credited for availability and affordability of animal products**
  - **Real consumer prices of most animal products - considerably lower than mid-20th century**

What does IFAP refer to?

- **Breeding**
- **Housing**
- **Feeding**
- **Waste management**
- **As part of industrialized supply chain:**
  - **Growing feed crops**
  - **Slaughtering animals**
  - **Processing carcasses into meat**

### Traditional Animal Agriculture
- Roughly 10,000 years old
- Poultry, swine, cattle raised on a small-scale, access to outdoors
- **Fair contract between humans and animals- 2 way relationship

## Egg Industry
- **One of the first to experience industrialization**
- Natural behaviors
  - Nest building, dust bathing, defecating away from nests

## CAFOs

- **CAFOs: Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations**
- **Production processes that**
  - **Concentrates large number of animals in a relatively small, confined places**
  - **Substitutes structures and equipment used in feeding, temperature control and manure management for land and labor**

## Feedlots

- **Confinement facilities, usually outdoors, where animals (usually cattle) are fed for the purpose of rapid weight gain prior to slaughter**

## AFO vs CAFO
- **An AFO (Animal Feeding Operation) is an agricultural operation where animals are kept and raised in confined situations (roofed or open) and confined for at least 45 days in a 12-month period, and there is no grass or other vegetation in the confinement area during the normal growing season**
- This would usually not include pastures, but would include feedlots, cow yards, and concentrated field areas

**A CAFO is a AFO that meets one of the regulatory definitions as a large, medium or small CAFO**

This is usually in regard to capacity, but Small CAFOs are designated on a case-by-case basis

### Meat
- A resource that Americans take for granted may be in store - something cheap, plentiful, widely enjoyed and a part of daily life. And it isn't oil. **It's Meat!**

- **Like oil, meat is subsidized by the federal government**
- **Like oil, meat is subject to accelerating demand as nations become wealthier, and this, in turn, sends prices higher**

## The good side of Industrial Farms
- **Large farmers - who are responsible for 80 percent of the food sales in the United States, are among the most progressive, technologically savvy growers on the planet**

- **Controlled atmosphere stunning: animals and birds unconscious before slaughtering**

### Milk

- **Milk is produced in all 50 states**

### Farmstead Dairies
- **Manufactured dairy products right on the farm**
- **Decreasing in number**

### Dedicated Patrons/cooperatives
- **Patrons produce milk, deliver raw milk to dairy plant**
- **Dairy plants further process and make products**

### Hormones / Growth Promotants in Milk
- Since 1950s, over 30 growth-promoting products approved by FDA for use in beef cattle in the US; **NO steroid hormone implants approved for growth of dairy cows, veal calves, pigs or poultry**

## Antibiotics
- **Overseen by FDA, USDA & CDC**
- **USDA and FDA ensure that:**
  - **Antibiotics are cleared from animals' system before milking process and before slaughter**
- **Marketing tools: antibiotic free labels**
  - Confuse customers who might not understand that all foods are antibiotic-free by regulatory standard

2013: FDA issues a set of guidelines _The Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food Producing Animals_ with 2 main principles:
  - **Use of medically important drugs should be limited to assuring animal health**
  - **Use should be limited to uses with veterinary oversight or consultation**
- **Ethically: antibiotic resistance is a significant problem with wide-ranging implications for human health**
