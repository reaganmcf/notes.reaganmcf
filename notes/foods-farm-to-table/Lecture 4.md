# Safety of Foods

- United states has the safest food supply in the world
- Broad topic
- Physical, chemical, biological hazards

### Today's consumers are concerned about the food they eat

- Food safety issues are top of mind for today's consumers, who are more likely to report an issue with food than ever before
- One third of 1000 respondents **said they are more concerned about food product safety and quality than they were a year ago, about 50 percent are more concerned than they were five years ago**

### Safety

- More than 80% of Americans believe that brand-name foods or from chain restaurants are safe
- Although 40% have changed their food habits after the brand or chain is linked to a case of food poisoning

**Myths**

- Rare burgers and raw eggs are safe to eat
- Preservatives make foods unsafe to eat
- Natural foods are safer than processed foods
- Foods that look and smell alright are safe to eat
- Cooked foods are sterile and don't need to be refrigerated
- Drinking alcohol protects shellfish eaters from contamination

- **HAND WASHING**: Can never be emphasized enough!

### Pink slime

- MYTH: "Meat glue" is used to hold chicken nuggets together
- FACT: **Transglutaminase**, referred to by some as **"meat glue", is an enzyme** sold for almost two decades that is used mostly in food serve to bind pieces of meat together, such as a beef tenderloin or a strip of bacon to a filet.

So, what's in a chicken nugget?

- Chicken nuggets are in fact typically made of the same meat you see in the super market, that is, broiler meat.
- Most chicken nuggets start as a split of chicken. You might read on the package that the product contains, "rib meat"
- Rib meat is simply a natural extension of the breast meat. It is NOT an additive or filler.

- ALL ingredients, including nutritional information, must be stated on the product's label.
- Keep in mind: _all_ federally inspected chicken processing plants follow string food safety standards and operate under the watch of USDA inspectors at _all_ times.

- \*\*Like all meat and poultry products, however, mechanically separated poultry is regulated and inspected by USDA and products containing it _must declare it as an ingredient_ on the label

### The Trade-Offs of Processed Foods

- Processed foods are products that have been preserved

  - They will not spoil as quickly as their fresh, whole raw counterparts
  - **Shelf-stable foods: Processes allow us to store the product at room temperature**
  - Primary reason for food processing: reduce or eliminate harmful microorganisms from growing in foods

- Processed foods take more energy to produce but usually take less energy to store than fresh foods

- Fresh, whole foods definitely more important components in a healthy diet
- At times, **processed foods are more appropriate**
- **Food banks**: stock, store, distribute processed foods that will not spoil rapidly
- **1st wave of supplies in response to natural disasters**, like earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis- bottled water, processed foods
- **Military missions, hiking, space foods** - convenient, easy to carry, quick energy
- **Formulated / medical foods** - to provide nutritious products

### Causes of Food Deterioration

- **Microorganisms: bacteria, yeast molds**
- **Activity of food enzymes**
- **Infestations by insects, parasites, and rodents**
- **Inappropriate temperatures during processing, storage**
- **Gain or loss of moisture**
- **Reaction with oxygen**
- **Light**
- **Physical stress or abuse**
- **Time**

### Processing improves food safety

- Food industry follows defined regulations for sanitary food handling, packaging, testing
- Standards set in order to reduce risks of food-borne illnesses
- FDA: defines CGMPs, food identity, microbiological quality standards, processing methods, equipment for food manufacturers
- **Food Safety & Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA + FDA: inspect and monitor US food production, processing and marketing**

### The "40-140 (Danger zone)" Rule

- **Foods should be held below 40 F _or_ Above 140 F**
