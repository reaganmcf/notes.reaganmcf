# Food Subsidies & Health: The Connection

5 Broad Food Industry Groups

1. Grain and oilseeds
2. Fruits and vegetables
3. Cattle
4. Dairy
5. Hogs, poultry, and eggs

## Grain and Oilseeds

- Souped-up engine of the American agricultural economy
- **Grains with greatest total value: corn, followed by Soybeans**
- **Grains with greatest food value: wheat, followed by rice**
- \*_Large, very large family farms prominent in grain and oilseeds_

## Fruits and Vegetables

- **Fruit and Nut Toppers: grapes, oranges, apples, almonds, strawberries**
- **Vegetable Toppers: potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes**
- No clear distinction between fruits & vegetables
- Tomato?
  - Way back in the day, fruits had no import tax while vegetables do have an import tax
  - **Economic ramifications; Tomato classified as a vegetable**

---

- **Centralization of food system**
- **Fast food industry demands uniform products encouraging centralization of every agricultural sector**
- **Fruits & vegetables, now grown, packaged and shipped like industrial commodities**

Reasons for food safety concerns and reporting of outbreaks

- **Improved reporting of outbreaks**
- **Aging population with weakened immune system, susceptible to food-borne illnesses**
- **Much produce eaten without cooking**

Food safety Regulatory system

- Responsibility of local, state and federal agencies
- Quicker response to localized public health problems
- Example, **states responsible for safe milk and sanitary operations of restaurants**
  - **New Jersey; bans sale of raw milk**

Reasons **why burgers are cheaper than salads**

- **Production costs**
- **Transportation and storage costs**

**Unhealthful foods, with the exceptions of cookies, have gotten a lot cheaper since 1978**

- Sodas are 33% cheaper
- Butter is 29% cheaper
- Beer is 15% cheaper
- Fish is 2% **more expensive**
- Vegetables are **41% more expensive**
- Fruits are **46% more expensive**

## Corn

- **Dent corn** = field corn; livestock feed
- Not necessarily unhealthy
- **Simultaneously a fruit, a grain and a vegetable**
- Target for food cops

#### Corn subsidies making us fat?

- **Federal farm subsidies always make our foods cheaper, leading to over-consumption: true or false?**
  - **NOT ALWAYS TRUE**
  - **But at times, farm subsidies lowered price of US farm commodities**
  - **Example: grain price, if lowered will lower the price of producing breakfast cereals, or bread**

**Common notion: obesity can be curbed by increased consumption of fruits & vegetables**

- By removing subsidies of grains, caloric consumption will be reduced; research shows an average adult weight would decline by only .35 lbs/person/year
- **No compelling evidence that doing so would have much influence on obesity**

**FACT: Increased subsidy is given to corn for fuel more than food**

## Sin tax

- Gaining momentum
- **Fat tax, a levy on sugary drinks and other unhealthy food products associated with obesity**

## Farm Subsidies

- **Farm subsidies are government financial benefits** paid to specific industries, like agribusiness
- Help reduce risk for farmers during bad seasons
- They have evolved to be very complex. As a result, **Only large producers can take advantage of farm subsidies**
- Why grains? **Grains provide 80% of the world's caloric needs. Grains can also be stored and affordably shipped.**

- The top five states receiving subsidies are Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, and Illinois.
- Corn is the nation's biggest crop.
- More than 15 billion bushels were grown in 2017, with 15% exported. The corn belt is Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Kansas. A third of Iowa's economy depends on farming.
- **California produces the most food by value. Most of its almonds, wine, dairy, walnuts, and pistachios. These aren't subsidized**

- **Grains are the most heavily subsidized, making them cheaper than vegetables and fruits**. As a result, grains make up one-fourth of the average American diet.
- Oil made from corn, soybeans, and canola contributed another quarter. **Fruits and vegetables are less than 10%**
- More than 6% of farm subsidies go toward four "junk food" components: corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, corn starch, and soy oils.

- The problem is that **subsidized commodities** financed by these policies **are not exactly aligned with U.S. dietary guidelines**
- Current **Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasizes** consumption of **fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy** while limiting consumption of saturated fats, sugars, salts, and refined grains.
- However, **U.S. subsidies focus on financing the production of foods like corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, dairy and livestock.**

### People often prefer "default" options

- Scenario:
- Sandwich + fries by default; salad an option for fries
- If Sandwich + salad by default; fries an option
- A healthier choice available

### Food decisions are often based more on emotion than rational thought
- Impulsive behavior
- Better lighting / attractive containers / more choice of fruits & vegetables

### People have problems with self-control when choosing food
- Immediate satisfaction
- Cravings
- Preselect healthier choices - an option

### External cues 

- **External cues can have a major effect of the food selected, the amount consumed, and an eater's perception of how much was consumed**
