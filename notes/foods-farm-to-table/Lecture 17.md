# Lecture 17 - The Resources

### Locavorism

A "locavore" or "localvore" (the term is a neologism) is a person interested in eating food that is locally produced, not moved long distances to market

### From Farms to the Shelves

- Industrial farms are major sources of pollution
- Fossil fuels are used
- Our food has to travel
- Fruits and vegetables spend 7 to 14 days in transit before they arrive in the store

### Footprints

- A "footprint" in genera has become known as a quantitative measure showing the appropriation of natural resources or pressure on the environment by human beings
- Carbon footprint measures the amount of greenhouse gases produced, measured carbon dioxide equivalents (in tons).
- Water footprint measures water use

### Fossil Fuel Use

- Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources that formed more than 300 million years ago
- Millions of years later we have three forms of fossil fuel: oil, natural gas and coal

### Carbon Footprint

- Greenhouse gasses include carbon dioxide and methane
- Remember, it's not just the carbon emissions that hurt; it's also the pesticides, fertilizers, fuel, and water needed to produce the feed for all those cows and pigs
- The message instead is simply to eat and waste less of what we produce and to look for greener options - meat from grass-fed, pasture-raised animals, for example
- Asking everyone to go vegetarian or vegan is not a realistic or attainable goal, chef and television personality Mario Batali told EWG. "But we can focus on a more plant-based diet and support the farmers who raise their animals humanely and sustainably"

### CO2 Emissions Ranked

1. Lamb
2. Beef
3. Cheese
4. Pork
5. Farmed Salmon
6. Turkey
7. Chicken
8. Canned Tuna
9. Eggs
10. Potatoes

### Thanksgiving

- The carbon footprint of the first Thanksgiving meal was approximatelyz zero.
- A bird emits a significantly smaller amount of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide in its waste than a cow or a sheep does.
- The green veggies are likely to be the most Earth-friendly part of your Thanksgiving meal
- Thanksgiving meals might be responsible for emitting more than 10 pounds of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere

### Food miles

- Food miles purportedly measure the carbon footprint of food production and distribution
- A single indicator based on miles traveled is not a valid indicator of sustainability 
- Growing food locally may require a considerable amount of carbon producing energy compared to growing in ideal, and sometimes distant, environments where production is less energy intensive
- Miles traveled is merely one small indicator of emission

- Smaller, family run farms do best in the local food economy
- Naysayers of local food systems: food transported long distances can have less of an environmental impact than locally growing foods

- In 2011, a study examined the effects of localizing all fruit and vegetable consumption in Santa Barbara county, CA
- Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was less than 1%

### Local Food Systems

If local food system produced food in a way that
- Sequesters soil carbon
- Naturally maintains soil fertility
- Does not depend on toxic chemicals
- Optimized transportation & distribution
- Consumers stored, prepared food in a way that conserved energy

Then there would be huge savings

### Water footprint

- The largest water footprint of a beverage company, for example, is not bottled water
- Instead, it can be traced to the main agricultural ingredients used in flavored drinks, such as sugar, oranges or barely

### Diesel

- Current fuel of choice
- Natural gas substitution?
- Not a suitable alternative
  - Premium product
  - Used for production of chemicals, plastics, fertilizers

- The more massive and slower a transportation vehicle is: the less energy it uses
- Lighter, high speed vehicles - deliver faster; with higher energy consumption

### Chocolate vs. Lettuce
- The real impact of distance when transporting foods, depends on caloric content of foods & transportation methods
- Lettuce: highly perishable; high impact on energy spent in relation to its energy content
- An iceberg lettuce flown from California to UK by air needs 127 calories of fuel for every calorie provided by the lettuce

### Waste Management

- High on food processor's agenda today
- Manufacturers and retailers are taking steps to reduce food waste, however
  - "hidden waste" is not accounted for in traditional waste disposal streams
  - Consumer waste is relatively greater than that associated with manufacturers and retailers

### Issues with Green Revolution
- Global warming - as it relies heavily on fossil fuels
- As an industry - farming world's single largest consumer of petroleum products - oil, coal, natural gas - finite
