# Processing of Cereals, Grains

## Milling

- Wheat, rice, corn, oats: commonly processed cereal grains
- De-hulled, ground into smaller pieces or flours
  - To improve palatability
  - Reduce cooking time
  - Create food products

**Removes outer hull which contains tough, fibrous material. Grains are revealed; can be toasted, soaked, or cooked to soften and release starch and carbohydrates.**

## Commodity crops

- **Corn and soybeans: increasing demand as both animal and human foods**; profitable in price
- Rice: relatively stable production last 20 years; not a dietary staple in the US
- Wheat: spike in prices

But what are commodity crops?

- **Wheat, Corn, Rice, Oats, Cotton, soybeans**

  - Can be easily traded
  - Stored for a long time
  - Grown in large quantities

- Example, when you think of cotton you don't ask where it's grown or what year it was harvested - it's just "cotton". That's what a **commodity crop** is

### Storage and Distribution

- Commodity crops; long shelf life when kept cool and dry
- At 70F: dried grains, beans last over 10 years
- **Minimum energy needed to store products**
- **Since perishability is not an issue, slow, cheap, transportation methods are used**

## Wheat kernel or seed:

- **Endosperm**: 83% of the grain; typically used in refined bread flower
- **Bran**: Rich in fiber, vitamins & minerals
- **Germ**: vitamins, minerals, fat, protein

### Steps in Wheat Milling

- Olden days millstones replaced today with rollers
  - Separate the bran, germ, and endosperm layers
    - Endosperm layer - starch or flour
- **Final milling by-product is wheat shorts**
  - **Consist of bran, germ, flour and tailings**
    - **Used to be for cattle feed only**
- **Now, the bran, germ marketed as "Viable health food"**

**Fatty acids in germ contribute to off-flavors and rancidity, it is removed; storage time of white flour improved when compared to wheat flour**

### Bleaching and maturing of flour

- \*_Final stage in the production of white flour_
- **FDA approved use of agents**
  - Nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tetroxide, chlorine dioxied, benzyl peroxide, acetone peroxides, azodicarbonamide
- WHY?
  - Fresh milled, unbleached flour - yellowish due to natral pigments in wheat
  - Fresh milled flour - yields small, coarse-textured loaf
- Solution: store the flour for several **months to lighten color, improve baking qualities**
- **FDA approved agents - similar effects in short period of time**

- Commerically made white bread, made from bleached flour, was considered a modern food and was more expensive than whole wheat bread
- **White bread was favored; a status symbol**
- 1920s: **wonder bread - with 12 vitamins, minerals - heavily advertised as healthy food for children**
- **Today, whole wheat bread is more expensive than white bread; changing dynamics of food technology, nutrition and science on food choices**

## Bread production

![](https://i.gyazo.com/1c77030d3f2ee232a5bd0a8db62025a4.png)

1. Ingredient mixing and dough development
2. Automatic dough slicing and depositing into bread pans/trays
3. Proofing / second rise
4. Baking the loaves in hot-air convection oven
5. Cooling the bread, separating the loaves from the bread pans
6. Slicing and packaging
7. Delivery to retail outlets

## Products from corn

- **Sweeteners: glucose, dextrose, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup**
- Oils, feed, meal, fiber foods
- Modified corn starch: thickeners in foods
- Ethanol: fuel and beverage alcohol

### Dry milling corn

- The **dry milling process** requires the miller to remove the corn hull and germ without reducing the endosperm
- This process produces flaking grits, meals, flours, oil
- **Breakfast cereal** is produced from large flaking grits

## Rice

- Has traveled from China to India/Pakistan to Africa to Middle East, to Europe, finally arriving in South Carolina
- **Labor-intensive crop**; utilized slave labor

- Rice is typically consumed in kernel form
- Outside rice hull - inedible; used for fuel or mulch
- **Brown rice: rice with outer bran layer**
- **White rice: bran removed**
- \*\*One of the most protected global agricultural commodities

### Broken rice

- During milling, rice often breaks - broken rice
- Not as valuable as unbroken rice; used by processors, cereal manufacturers and pet food manufacturers

## Soybeans

- The two major products from soybean processing are high-protein meal and oil.
- Food uses of oil include shortening, margarine, and cooking and salad oils; nonfood uses include paint, varnish, resins, and plastics
- **Soybean meal, which is the largest product produced from this process, is used by the feed industry as a protein supplement.**

- Bean family; primarily used for:
  - Livestock feed
  - Vegetable oil (80% of oil consumed in US)

Once beans reach the processors

- Processed directly into products made from whole soybeans - soymilk, flour, tofu
- Further refining: clean, dry, crack the hull form soybean
  - Hulls go for animal feed
- Remaining portion converted into animal food flakes and soy flour
  - Flakes: used to extract soybean oil and lecithin
  - **Lecithin: widely used emulsifier in salad dressings, mayonnaise, ice cream...**

## Oats

### Steel Cut Oats

- Whole grains is cut into several pieces
- Longest to cook
- Toothsome, chewy texture

### Rolled oats

- Whole grains first steamed then pressed to flatten them
- Cook faster than steel-cut oats

### Instant Oats

- Most processed
- Whole grains pre-cooked, dried, and then rolled and pressed thinner
- Cook more quickly
